# FLAnimation

## Description

*FLAnimation* is a small library which loads Flash animations (XFL) and converts them to CoreAnimation.
It is designed to add animations to your existing iOS project using the Adobe Flash IDE.

Currently *FLAnimation* supports:

* Bitmaps
* Shapes
* Nested timelines
* Transformations
* Tweens (easeIn & easeOut)
* Tweens using guides (with orientToPath)
* Sounds
* Actionscript 

There is still a lot of work to be done. So what's next:

* Add masks
* Add custom ease
* Add more Actionscript functions

## Known issues/bugs:

* Shape fills don't work
* Memory errors thrown by TouchXML

## Getting started
